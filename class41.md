## Deploy to Vercel
The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform developed by the creators of Next.js.

Vercel is an all-in-one platform with Global CDN supporting static & JAMstack deployment and Serverless Functions. We believe Vercel is the optimal place to deploy Next.js apps. You can start using it for free â€” no credit card required.

Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js and has first-class support for Next.js. When you deploy your Next.js app to Vercel, the following happens by default:

Pages that use Static Generation and assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc) will automatically be served from the Vercel Edge Network, which is blazingly fast.
Pages that use Server-Side Rendering and API routes will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions. This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely.

### Vercel has many more features, such as:
**Custom Domains:**  Once deployed on Vercel, you can assign a custom domain to your Next.js app. Take a look at our documentation here.

**Environment Variables:** You can also set environment variables on Vercel. Take a look at our documentation here. You can then use those environment variables in your Next.js app.

**Automatic HTTPS:** HTTPS is enabled by default (including custom domains) and doesn't require extra configuration.
We auto-renew SSL certificates.
