# Unit tests and TDD
**Unit tests:**\
 some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.
 
 **TDD** completely turns traditional development around. When you first go to implement a new feature,\
 the first question that you ask is whether the existing design is the best design possible that enables you to implement that functionality.\
 If so, you proceed via a TFD approach. If not, you refactor it locally to change the portion of the design affected by the new feature,\
 enabling you to add that feature as easy as possible. As a result you will always be improving the quality of your design,\
 thereby making it easier to work with in the future.\
 
 # Recursion
 ### What is Recursion? \
 The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.\
 
 ### difference between direct and indirect recursion:\
 In the direct recursion, only one function is called by itself but in indirect recursion more than one function are by the other function and number of times.\
 The indirect recursion does not make any overhead as direct recursion.
